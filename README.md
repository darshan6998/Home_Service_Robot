## Overview  
In this project was to use create a robot in a virtual environment along with a virtual object. The task of the robot was to navigate to the initial goal position, pick up the object and drop it off at the next goal position. 
It had to do that while navigating the environment on it own. The robot is able to perform Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping or SLAM.   
### Mapping

You will create a `test_slam.sh` script file and launch it to manually test SLAM.  
A functional map of the environment should be created which would be used for localization and navigation tasks.  
### Localization and Navigation

You will create a `test_navigation.sh` script file to launch it for manual navigation test.  
Your robot should be able to navigate in the environment after a 2D Nav Goal command is issued.  
You will create a `pick_objects.sh` file that will send multiple goals for the robot to reach.  
The robot travels to the desired pickup zone, displays a message that it reached its destination, waits 5 seconds, travels to the desired drop off zone, and displays a message that it reached the drop off zone."  
### Home Service Functions  
You will create a `add_marker.sh` file that will publish a marker to rviz.  
The marker should initially be published at the pickup zone. After 5 seconds it should be hidden. Then after another 5 seconds it should appear at the drop off zone.
The student should write a home_service.sh file that will run all the nodes in this project.  
The student's home service robot should be simulated as follow:  
* Initially show the marker at the pickup zone.
* Hide the marker once your robot reach the pickup zone.
* Wait 5 seconds to simulate a pickup.
* Show the marker at the drop off zone once your robot reaches it.

## Run the project  
* Clone this repository
https://github.com/darshan6998/Home_Service_Robot_Udacity
```
* Navigate to the `src` folder and clone the necessary repositories  
```
cd home/workspace/catkin_ws/src  
git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/slam_gmapping.git  
git clone https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot.git  
git clone https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot_interactions.git  
git clone https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot_simulator.git  
```
* Open the repository, make and source  
```
cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```
* Launch the home service robot
```
./src/scripts/home_service.sh
```
* Done. 

## Tips  
1. It's recommended to update and upgrade your environment before running the code.  
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```
2. If your system python version from miniconda is python3 while the ros packages and tf are python2. A hack is to just set the system python to python2 via symbol link. Run the following commands to resolve it  
```
ln -s /usr/bin/python2 /root/miniconda3/bin/python
```
3. How to setup your environment at start up.  
```
Add the following line into the /home/workspace/.student_bashrc
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages  
pip install catkin_pkg  
pip install rospkg  
```
4. How create package with dependencies  
```
catkin_create_pkg pick_objects move_base_msgs actionlib roscpp  
catkin_create_pkg add_markers roscpp visualization_msgs  
```
5. How to visualize your marker in the rviz  
To see the marker(virtual objects) demo, in addition to running the `./add_marker.sh`, you will need to manually add a 'Marker' in rviz with the following steps:  
* Find your rviz window  
* In the left bottom panel, click "Add" button  
* In 'By display type' tab, navigate the tree to 'rviz' then 'Marker'  
* Click 'OK' button  
* Done, you should see the marker(virtual objects) appear, disappear then appear again  

## Code Style  
Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
